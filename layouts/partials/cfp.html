<p itemprop="description">We are planning a session of open talks on general topics and open problems related to learning on graphs and geometry. Authors whose abstracts are accepted to the workshop will pitch their work to the full audience and will participate in a poster session. The best submissions will also be chosen for a long oral presentation.</p>


<p>Authors should upload a long abstract of up to two (2) pages in PDF format during the submission process. A simple overleaf template is available as an example <b>(available soon)</b>. </p>


<p>Talks abstracts must be submitted through the submission form <b>(available soon)</b>. If your work belongs to one of the subject areas below, please specify on the form.</p>


<p>In the case that the number of applications should exceed the number of talks that can be included in the session, the organizing committee will reserve the right to select a limited number of talks. More information on timing will be released as the schedule of the main conference is made known.</p>



<!--<p>Authors must clearly indicate in their abstracts the kinds of submissions that the papers belong to, to help reviewers better understand their contributions. All papers will be (single blind) peer reviewed.</p>-->
