<!--<p>That's why we created this project! <a href="https://github.com/braziljs/conf-boilerplate" target="_blank">Conf Boilerplate</a> is an iniciative of <a href="http://braziljs.org" target="_blank">BrazilJS Foundation</a> that provides a simple structure built on top of Docpad, a static generator in NodeJS, with all the things you need to create a event. We also provide a responsive template with i18n!</p>
